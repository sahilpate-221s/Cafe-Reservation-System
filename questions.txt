🎤 INTERVIEW ANSWERS (MEMORIZE THESE)
❓ How did you prevent double booking?

“I used a two-layer approach: Redis distributed locking with atomic SET NX EX to handle concurrency, and a MongoDB compound unique index as a final safety net. I validated this by running concurrent and stress tests where only one booking succeeded.”

❓ Where is authentication and authorization handled?

“Both authentication and RBAC are handled at the API Gateway. The gateway verifies JWTs, injects user context via headers, and blocks unauthorized requests before they reach any service.”

❓ Why not handle RBAC inside services?

“Centralizing RBAC in the gateway avoids duplication, keeps services focused on business logic, and provides a single security boundary — which is the standard microservices pattern.”

❓ How do you handle abuse or brute-force attacks?

“I implemented Redis-based rate limiting at the gateway. Login attempts are limited per IP, and booking attempts are limited per user with TTL-based counters.”

❓ What happens if Redis goes down?

“The system is designed to fail open for rate limiting but still remains safe for bookings because MongoDB unique constraints guarantee data correctness.”
